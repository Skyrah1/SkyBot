# SkyBot
A Discord bot for a D&amp;D server

# Setup
Before running, install dependencies by typing "npm install <dependency>" into the terminal.
The following dependencies are needed:
- discord.js
- readfile-sync
- discordjs/opus OR node-opus (deprecated) OR opusscript
- ytdl-core
- ffmpeg-static

# Running
NOTE: An instance of this bot is running on the cloud. If you use the same login token, you will receive messages from each instance of the bot.
To run the bot, type "node js/bot.js" while in the file containing the repository.
A message will appear prompting you to enter the login token. Copy and paste that onto the terminal, then press enter.
Another message will appear prompting you to enter the creator's client ID (i.e. mine). Ignoring this field doesn't affect the functionality (though if you're really cheeky you can go ahead and put your own client ID in).
