Supercell
Phibi casts Call Lightning, followed quickly by Nicholas doing the same. The combined effect amplifies the damage of the lightning. Can be maximized further with Channel Divinity: Destructive Wrath.
Extension: Thunderbird - Phibi turns into a Giant Eagle (or other Large flying creature) and lets Nicholas use her as a mount, combining destructive power with high mobility.
"Thunderbolts and lightning,
Very very frightening me!"
