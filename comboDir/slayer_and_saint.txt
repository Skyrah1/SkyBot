Slayer And Saint
Tate casts Holy Weapon on one of See-Reos' weapons which allows him, using Action Surge, to single out an enemy and execute them. A missed attack can be made to hit with War God's Blessing, provided that See-Reos remains within 30 feet.
Extension: Empty Blade - Instead of remaining close to Tate, See-Reos can use Misty Step to teleport towards a group of enemies or a spellcaster. After the first round of attacks, Tate can end Holy Weapon on his turn to deal AoE damage 30 feet around See-Reos and potentially blind opponents, allowing the Mage Slayer to make a hasty retreat...or finish off a vulnerable mage that relies on sight for spells.
Extension: Divine Execution - On subsequent turns, Tate can cast Guiding Bolt on the same enemy that See-Reos is attacking while maintaining Holy Blade, allowing him to hit more consistently while dealing damage. Repeat this ad nauseum.
