Crash and Burn
See-reos casts Booming Blade on an enemy, followed by Phibi's Flaming Sphere. This forces the enemy to either move (and take damage) or stand and fight (and also take damage).
Extension: Grounded - Tate casts Guardian of Faith on top of the enemy, punishing them more for moving away.
"A strange game.
The only winning move is not to play."
