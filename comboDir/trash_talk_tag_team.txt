Trash Talk Tag Team
Alistair uses Panache on a weakened enemy that is focused on Nicholas, allowing him a moment to recover. Between Alistair's mobility and range, Nicholas' durability, and more opportunities for creative insults, they are able to stall for more time together than they would on their own.
Extension: Sailor's Blessing - Nicholas buffs and heals Alistair with supportive spells while Panache is active, allowing him to give his Swashbuckler frenemy the upper hand without breaking its effect.
Extension: Unfair Advantage - Instead of retreating, Nicholas stays within melee range of the enemy during his recovery phase, putting himself at risk but allowing Alistair to still benefit from flanking during Panache.
Extension: Dirty "Duel" - Nicholas grapples the enemy and/or shoves him to the ground while he is distracted by Panache which...technically also doesn't break its effects? (needs DM confirmation as to whether "attacking" in the description means "making attack rolls" or whether it also includes "things you can do when you take the Attack action")
Extension: NIGERUNDAYO, SMOKEY! - Finally doin the smart thing, Nicholas takes the opportunity to run for the hills, after preparing an exit for Alistair if there isn't already one present. Once the Tempest Cleric is safe, Alistair uses his movement, action and Cunning Action to catch up.
